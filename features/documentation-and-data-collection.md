# Data collection

Users working with an organization can upload photos, videos, and audio files, or fill and submit forms, to document events they are witnessing. The organization decides which method is most appropriate to their needs and capacity: receiving the files through a third-party app like WhatsApp or Signal; or using forms get ask questions about the specific data they need \(see [Choosing the right documentation method](../deploying-tella/choosing-the-right-documentation-method.md)\). Previous Tella deployments have ranged between 10 and 2,000 users. 

Tella includes an "Offline Mode" for users who are collecting data in remote areas with limited or no internet connection. When Offline Mode is activated, all data is saved on the app and and users can submit it easily when they reach an internet connection.

If you are an organization and would like to use Tella for data collection, feel free to contact us at contact@tella-app.org to request additional information, technical or strategic support, or new features.
