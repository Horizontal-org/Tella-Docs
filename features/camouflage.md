# Camouflage

In order to protect the data produced and shared through Tella, the application and its content can be hidden on a user's device.

The icon for the app can be changed to a seemingly harmless one, such as a calculator or a camera icon. This means that an individual searching a device will not see the Tella name and icon, and instead see an app that doesn't raise suspicion.

WARNING: The Tella name and icon will remain visible in the Android settings; this means that this camouflage will not protect against an individual _actively_ looking for Tella or conducting an in-depth analysis of a device. This camouflage offers good protection against superficial searches of a user's device - deterring suspicions that may arise if an individual is quickly searching for incriminating evidence.
