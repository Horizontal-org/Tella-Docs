# Tella in a nutshell

Tella is a documentation app for Android. In challenging environments--with limited or no internet connectivity or in the face of repression--Tella makes it easier and safer to document events, whether thatâ€™s violence, human rights violations, corruption, or electoral fraud.

Tella has three main objectives:

* Protecting users who engage in documentation from physical and digital repression
* Protecting the data they collect from censorship, tampering, interception, and destruction
* Empowering individuals and groups to easily, quickly, and effectively collect data and produce high quality documentation that can be used for research, advocacy, or transitional justice
