# Contributing to Tella Development

The following are guidelines for contributing to Tella source code. 

This software uses the following open source packages:

* SQLCipher for our encrypted database.
* CacheWord for passphrase caching and management.
* ODK JavaRosa to work with XForms.
* CameraView, ExoPlayer, RxJava, OkHttp, Retrofit, PermissionDispatcher, PatternLock and a lot of other excellent libraries helping all of us in Android application development.

## Contributing to the code

**Step 1: Get familiar with Tella.** The best way is simply to download Tella play with it and try the different features, or [read our documentation here](https://docs.tella-app.org).

**Step 2: Find an issue to work on.** Please find an issue that you would like to take on and comment to assign yourself if no one else has done so already. [All issues with the label `good first issue`](https://github.com/Horizontal-org/Tella-Android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are good ways to get started. Also, feel free to ask questions in the issues, and we will get back to you ASAP!

**Step 3: Fork the repo** Click the "fork" button in the upper right of the Github repo page. A fork is a copy of the repository that allows you to freely explore & experiment without changing the original project. You can learn more about forking a repo [in this article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

**Step 4: Create a branch** Create a new branch for your issue from `develop` branch. You can name it anything, but we encourage you to use the format `XXX-brief-description-of-feature` where XXX is the issue number.

**Step 5: Code away!** Feel free to discuss any questions on the issues as needed, and we will get back to you! Don't forget to write some tests to verify your code. Commit your changes locally, using descriptive messages and please be sure to note the parts of the app that are affected by this commit.

**Step 6: Pushing your branch and creating a pull request** Push your branch up and create a pull request. Please indicate which issue your PR addresses in the title.
